# 📚 Library Management System (C++)

A console-based Library Management System built using C++ to simulate real-world book tracking, borrower management, and fine calculation based on late returns. Developed as part of my DSA practice .


##  Features

- 📕 Add new books to the library
- 🔍 Search books by Title, Author, or ISBN
- 📤 Issue books to borrowers with automated due date tracking (14 days)
- 📥 Return books with fine calculation based on delay
- 👤 Manage borrowers and view their borrowing history
- 🧮 Calculates late fine (`₹5` per day after due date)
- 🕓 Uses real-time system date for issue/return logic


##  What I Learned

- STL usage for vectors and efficient data handling
- Time manipulation using `<ctime>` for due dates and delay tracking
- Modular design with clean separation of functionalities
- Better understanding of user-centric application flow
- Reinforced concepts of structs, file-less persistence, and logical checks
